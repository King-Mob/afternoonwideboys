# Events File Template

To add events, write them in between "Events Start" and "Events End".
This file is the actual one that currently creates the events running on the site.

## Events Start

@0:05 note "Being straight is a curse" 2000
@0:11 note "Tom's fashion sense is truly a blessing" 3000
@0:19 quiz "Why do we go inside Tom's shirt?" "caress his manly hair" "check him for spying equipment" "distract from life's despair" 1
@0:25 size-change 1000 1500
@0:26 size-change 390 640
@0:29 background "https://media.giphy.com/media/xThuWcaa4U4XZQDgvm/giphy.gif" 700

## Events End

## Instructions

### Note

@m:ss note "content in quotes" duration-in-milliseconds

e.g. @0:01 note "I love notes" 1000

### Quiz

@m:ss quiz "question?" "answer" "answer" "answer" correct-answer-number

the correct-answer number is 0-indexed, meaning that the first answer is number 0, the second is 1 etc. You can have up to 10 answers, because the correct answer is 1 digit, so can be 0 to 9. I suppose you could have a hundred answers, but none of the last 90 could be correct.

e.g. @0:01 quiz "which is best?" "snow" "ice" "hail" 2
this means that "hail" is the correct answer

### Size Change

@m:ss size-change height-in-pixels width-in-pixels

e.g. @0:01 size-change 400 400

### Background Image

@m:ss background "url of image" duration-in-milliseconds

e.g.

@0:01 background "https://i1.wp.com/snookerhq.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/snooker-table-WST.jpeg?w=960&ssl=1" 1000

Who knows what events will be added next?

## Note on  the format format

The events are transformed into the following JavaScript Object Notation, or JSON. I might just have people upload this, because it's not that much more complicated than the sytnax I've created above. However I've written the transformer now, so I'd hate for all that great work to go to waste.

```const events = [
    {
        type: "note",
        time: 5,
        duration: 2000, 
        content: "Being straight is a curse"
    },
    {
        type: "note",
        time: 11,
        duration: 3000,
        content: "I love Tom's fashion sense"
    },
    {
        type: "quiz",
        time: 19,
        question: "Why do we go inside Tom's shirt?",
        answers: [
            "caress his manly hair",
            "check him for spying equipment",
            "distract from life's despair"
        ],
        correct: 1,
        answered: false
    },
    {
        type: "size-change",
        time: 25,
        height: 1000,
        width: 1500,
    },
    {
        type: "size-change",
        time: 26,
        height: 390,
        width: 640,
    },
    {
        type: "background",
        time: 29,
        url: "https://media.giphy.com/media/xThuWcaa4U4XZQDgvm/giphy.gif",
        duration: 700
    }
];
```
